# THE SQUIGGLE CITY HERALD MOBILE READER

This is an attempt to make [THE SQUIGGLE CITY HERALD][1] readable
on mobile devices. Since `.txt` files are word wrapped by default
on many mobile browsers, content for the paper is wrapped in a
strange way. This simple node.js server should transparently
return html wrapped text with styles that allow proper viewing
on mobile devices.
